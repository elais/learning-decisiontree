# Assignment: Learning: DecisionTree

The goal of this assignment is to give you some experience implementing a supervised classifier, specifically, a decision tree. It assumes you have already familiarized yourself with Git and Maven in a previous assignment.

## Get a copy of the assignment template

1. Fork the repository https://git.cis.uab.edu/cs-460/learning-decisiontree.

2. Give your instructor access to your fork. **I cannot grade your assignment unless you complete this step.**

## Compile and test the code

1.  Compile the code. Run the following command:

        mvn compile

    Everything should compile and you should see a message like:

        [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
        [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  Test the code. Run the following command:

        mvn test

    The tests should fail, and you should see a message like:

        TODO

## Implement your part of the code

Your task is to implement TODO

## Test your code

1.  Re-run the tests:

        mvn test

    You should now see a message like:

        [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
        [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Your code is now passing the tests that were given to you. This is a good sign, but note that a successful `mvn test` does not guarantee you full credit on an assignment. I will run extra tests on your code when grading it.

## Submit your assignment

1.  To submit your assignment, make sure that you have pushed all of your changes to your repository at `git.cis.uab.edu`.

2.  I will inspect the date of your last push to your `git.cis.uab.edu` repository. If it is after the deadline, your submission will be marked as late. So please **do not push changes to `git.cis.uab.edu` after the assignment deadline** unless you intend to submit a late assignment.
